# RutAdaptBoard-UVA LED Odor Eliminator

This is an odor-eliminator concept. The ultra-high frequency PWM is used to generate UVA light Trichel pulses that are exposing the TiO2 catalyst. The VOC – Volatile Organic Compounds are degrading on the TiO2 catalyst surface down to the harmless and odorless components.
